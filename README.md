## Supported algorithms

### Cryptographic hashes

| Algo   | Crate name    | SIMD               |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Blake  | blake-hash    | [1]                |
| Gr√∏stl | groestl-aesni | :heavy_check_mark: |
| JH     | jh-x86\_64    | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Skein  | skein-hash    | :x:                |

[1] SIMD is available for builds with target-cpu/target-feature configured, but
runtime CPU detection is not yet supported.

### Block ciphers

| Algo       | Crate name       | SIMD               |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Threefish  | threefish-cipher | :x:                |

### Stream ciphers

| Algo       | Crate name | SIMD               |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| ChaCha     | c2-chacha  | :heavy_check_mark: |
