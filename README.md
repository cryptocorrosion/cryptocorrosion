# Cryptocorrosion

Cryptographic algorithms in pure Rust.

The main interface to these crates is the RustCrypto traits.

All crates are no-std compatible.

Minimum Rust version:
- algorithm crates (with RustCrypto API): 1.41.0
- support crates: 1.32.0

## Supported algorithms

### Cryptographic hashes

| Algo   | Crate name    | SIMD               |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Blake  | blake-hash    | [1]                |
| Gr√∏stl | groestl-aesni | :heavy_check_mark: |
| JH     | jh-x86\_64    | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Skein  | skein-hash    | :x:                |

[1] SIMD is available for builds with target-cpu/target-feature configured, but
runtime CPU detection is not yet supported.

### Block ciphers

| Algo       | Crate name       | SIMD               |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Threefish  | threefish-cipher | :x:                |

### Stream ciphers

| Algo       | Crate name | SIMD               |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| ChaCha     | c2-chacha  | :heavy_check_mark: |

## SIMD

Many of the crates in this project include optimized SIMD implementations,
enabled by default on x86-64 by the "simd" feature. The fastest implementation
available for your hardware will be automatically selected at runtime, except
in no-std builds.

For other hardware platforms, e.g. ARM: an alternative, portable SIMD backend
based on the packed\_simd crate is available for recent nightly Rust; you can
enable it as "packed\_simd". 

If you'd prefer to minimize usage of `unsafe` code: disable the "simd" feature
to switch to a generic implementation.

| feature        | crate        | no `unsafe`        | rust version   | build time? | performance   |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| simd (default) | ppv\_lite86  | :x:                | 1.27           | fast        | fast          |
| (no simd)      | ppv\_null    | :heavy_check_mark: |                | fast        | slow          |
| packed\_simd   | packed\_simd |                    | recent nightly | slow        | fast          |
